# Networking Basics
The 4 main concepts of networking are:
1. Clients and Servers
2. IP Addresses
3. Network Hubs, Switches, and Cables
4. Routers and Firewalls

**Clients and Servers** -
A server is a computer that holds content and services such as a website, a media file, or a chat application. 
An example of a server would be a website like [Google](https://www.google.com). 
A client is a different computer, such as your laptop or cell phone, that requests to view, download, or use the content. 

**IP Addresses** -
In order to send and direct data across a network, computers need to be able to identify destinations and origins. 
This identification is an IP—Internet Protocol—address. 
IP Addresses are similar to street addresses as they identify the specific location of your network.

**Network Hubs, Switches, and Cables** -
Traditionally, computers are connected to each other using cables—creating a network. 
The cable used most often is Ethernet, which consists of four pairs of wires inside of a plastic jacket.
But cables and computers alone do not make a good network, so one early solution was to use a network hub. 
The Ethernet cables from the computer connect to the device similar to the hub of a bike wheel—where all of the spokes come together in the center.
A network using a hub can slow down if many computers are sending messages, since they may try and send messages at the same time and confuse the hub. To help with this problem, networks began to use another device called a switch. 
Instead of repeating all messages that come in, a switch only sends the message to the intended destination. 
This eliminates the unnecessary repetition of the hub.

**Routers and Firewalls** -
Routers do the majority of the hard work on a network - 
they make the decisions about all the messages that travel on the network, and whether to pass messages to and from outside networks.

Routers have 3 main functions:![3 Functions of Routers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pw257/Final-Project-Digital-Concept/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-05-07%20at%209.16.07%20PM.png)
